        <h2>Learning and teaching are inseparable</h2>
        <p>Why I care not just that students learn, but that they learn to teach.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <p>
          I often see the slogan “What is important is learning, not teaching.” At first glance this sounds noble,
          but I find it incomplete. Learning never happens in a vacuum: it always involves some form of teaching,
          whether from an instructor, a peer, a book, or the learner talking themselves through an idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Historically, English even used “learn” in the sense of “to teach,” and many scientists and educators
          have emphasized that you only really understand something when you can explain it clearly to someone else.
          In that spirit, my goal is not just that students learn content, but that they
          <strong>learn to teach what they have learned</strong>, to a classmate, a younger sibling, or a parent at the
          dinner table.
        </p>
        <p>
          Practically, this means I design activities where students summarize a concept in their own words,
          talk through a problem solution to a partner, or prepare a short “mini-explanation” to share with the class.
          When students take on the role of teacher, even briefly, they confront gaps in their understanding and build
          confidence in their voice.

        <h2>Being wrong is what makes being right meaningful</h2>
        <p>Creating a classroom where error is a resource, not a failure.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <p>
          I resonate with the idea that teachers can and do make mistakes. What matters is not pretending to be
          infallible, but modeling how to respond when we are wrong. For me, error is not just a liability to be
          minimized; it is a central part of the learning process.
        </p>
        <p>
          In mathematics education, George Pólya argued that students should be encouraged to guess, explore, and revise
          their thinking. Wrong answers are not simply discarded; they are examined: what part of the reasoning was
          insightful, where did it go astray, and how can it be repaired? I try to adopt this stance in my own teaching.
          Rather than rushing to the “official” solution, I like to put several student ideas on the board and work
          through them, highlighting both their strengths and their flaws.
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach feels even more urgent now that AI systems can quickly produce correct answers. If correctness
          alone is the goal, a machine will usually be faster. A human classroom adds value when it cultivates
          <strong>curiosity, resilience, and the habit of reasoning out loud</strong>. I want students to see that
          thoughtful mistakes are not something to be ashamed of; they are the raw material out of which understanding
          is built.
        </p>
        <p>
          One analogy I draw from my engineering background is overfitting: a model that perfectly matches past data may
          fail utterly on new situations. In the same way, students who only memorize polished solutions may struggle
          when faced with a novel problem. A classroom that tolerates and analyzes error helps them develop knowledge
          that generalizes beyond the specific homework set or exam.

        <h2>Assessment through challenge and growth</h2>
        <p>Grading not just what students can do now, but how far they have come.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <p>
          Because I see learning as a process of exploration, I am wary of grading systems that reward only quick
          correctness on routine exercises. Instead, I am drawn to assessments built around
          <strong>very challenging problems</strong>, tasks that students cannot immediately solve, but can gradually
          approach as their understanding deepens.
        </p>
        <p>
          In such a system, a student’s final grade is not determined solely by their absolute score on a fixed set of
          hard problems. Rather, it reflects <strong>how much progress they have made</strong> relative to where they
          began. A student who starts out unable to make any headway on a difficult proof but, by the end of the
          semester, can outline a strategy and justify key steps should be recognized for that growth, even if their
          work is still imperfect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concretely, I imagine structures like:
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>
            A sequence of “challenge problems” revisited multiple times during the course, with students submitting
            improved attempts and reflections.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rubrics that explicitly separate <em>current level of mastery</em> from <em>degree of improvement</em>,
            so a student can earn credit for meaningful progress.
          </li>
          <li>
            Opportunities for revision: students can rework earlier solutions after feedback, demonstrating how their
            thinking has evolved.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This growth-oriented assessment signals to students that struggling with a hard question is not a sign that
          they do not “belong” in mathematics. Instead, it is an expected and valued part of the course. I want grades
          to tell a story not just about where students ended up, but about the <strong>journey</strong> they took to
          get there.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- Shared journey -->
  <section class="section" id="shared-journey">
    <div class="section-inner">
      <div class="section-header">
        <h2>Education as a shared journey</h2>
        <p>Teacher and students learning from each other.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <p>
          Ultimately, I see education as a shared journey rather than a one-way transfer of information. My role as a
          teacher is not to act as an unerring authority, but as a guide who creates conditions for exploration and
          dialogue. Students, in turn, are not passive recipients; they are active participants who question, explain,
          test ideas, and help each other learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I invite students to teach small pieces of the course to one another, when I treat wrong answers as
          starting points for inquiry, and when I assess them based on their growth on challenging tasks, I am trying to
          align my practice with this belief. In doing so, I also hold myself accountable: if I want students to learn
          deeply, I must keep learning how to teach more thoughtfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          In that sense, my teaching philosophy is also a learning philosophy. I teach because I want to understand
          better; I ask students to explain because I want them to understand better. The classroom works best when
          everyone in it, students and instructor alike, are both teachers and learners.
