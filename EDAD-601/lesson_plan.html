          Begin by showing the study <em>“They Don’t Read Very Well”</em>, which describes a mismatch
          between standardized literacy test scores and students’ ability to carry out an actual
          reading task. Ask students:
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>What went wrong in this study?</li>
          <li>How does this relate to critical thinking in our own classrooms?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Use the discussion to motivate the rest of the lesson: high scores and apparent success
          do not guarantee deep understanding or effective thinking.

          <li>
            <strong>Obstacles to critical thinking (whole-class brainstorm)</strong><br>
            Immediately after the opening study, use a random student selection method to invite
            several students (e.g., four) to name an obstacle that prevented critical thinking
            in the scenario. Record their responses where everyone can see them.<br>
            Then, show the list of obstacles from the textbook and compare them to the
            class-generated list.
          </li>

          <li style="margin-top:0.7rem;">
            <strong>Po-Shen Loh video on problem solving</strong><br>
            Show a short video of Po-Shen Loh (coach of the U.S. IMO team) emphasizing the
            importance of thinking about how to solve a problem rather than expecting to be
            shown the method. Use this as a springboard to discuss students’ expectations of
            instruction versus their own responsibility for thinking.
          </li>

          <li style="margin-top:0.7rem;">
            <strong>Bloom’s original taxonomy → Anderson &amp; Krathwohl revision</strong><br>
            Present nouns from Bloom’s original taxonomy of cognitive levels. Randomly select
            students to propose appropriate action verbs that might correspond to each level.
            After collecting suggestions, reveal the verbs from the revised taxonomy of
            Anderson and Krathwohl and compare:
            <ul class="bullet-list" style="margin-top:0.25rem;">
              <li>Where do the students’ verbs align with the revised taxonomy?</li>
              <li>Where do they differ, and what does that say about how they view learning?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li style="margin-top:0.7rem;">
            <strong>Perry’s scheme</strong><br>
            Introduce key terms from Perry’s scheme for epistemological development
            (e.g., dualism, multiplicity, relativism, commitment). Randomly select students to
            guess what each term might mean and how it might relate to Bloom’s taxonomy.<br>
            Facilitate a short discussion on how cognitive level and epistemological stance
            interact in the classroom.
          </li>

          <li style="margin-top:0.7rem;">
            <strong>SOLO taxonomy</strong><br>
            Present the main levels of the SOLO taxonomy. Again, randomly select students to
            infer meanings of the terms and then compare with any previous frameworks discussed.
            Highlight similarities and differences among Bloom, Perry, and SOLO.
          </li>

          <li style="margin-top:0.7rem;">
            <strong>Other frameworks and learning styles</strong><br>
            Briefly touch on additional frameworks mentioned in the textbook. Note in particular
            the limited empirical support behind many learning style models and the risks of
            over-interpreting them.
          </li>

          <li style="margin-top:0.7rem;">
            <strong>Strategies for encouraging critical thinking</strong><br>
            Using random selection, ask students to suggest practical strategies instructors
            could use to encourage critical thinking in their own courses. Collect a list of
            takeaways and then compare it to the guidelines presented in the textbook.

          If time allows, show an excerpt from Steven Krantz’s <em>How to Teach Mathematics</em>
          that describes the Moore method (students proving results themselves rather than being
          shown proofs).
        </p>
        <p>
          Ask students to form groups of 4-5 and discuss:
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>What are the advantages of the Moore method for cognitive development?</li>

          <li>What kinds of students or classrooms might benefit most from this approach?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Have a few groups share their insights with the whole class to surface different

          Conclude by revisiting the key points:
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>
            Obstacles to higher-order thinking are common, and recognizing them is the
            first step toward addressing them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Different frameworks (Bloom, Anderson &amp; Krathwohl, Perry, SOLO) offer
            complementary ways to think about student learning and development.
          </li>
          <li>
            Instructors can actively design activities and environments that push students
            to think more deeply, not just perform well on tests.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Return briefly to the opening study, emphasizing that strong performance on a
          standardized test did not predict success on the authentic reading task. Encourage
          students to cultivate habits of asking <strong>why</strong> an answer is correct,
          not only <strong>what</strong> the answer is.

          <h3>Planned evaluation</h3>
          <p>
            The original plan was to build a short multiple-choice quiz on the companion
            website so students could check their understanding of key concepts (frameworks,
            obstacles, and strategies). This quiz was not completed in time for the lesson,
            but remains a future improvement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Qualitative evaluation will take place through class discussion, informal checks
            for understanding, and a later written self-evaluation of the teaching session.

          <h3>Ambitious scope</h3>
          <p>
            The lesson plan is deliberately ambitious: there are many frameworks and activities
            to cover in a single hour. It is likely that some parts will need to be abbreviated
            or skipped to finish on time.
          </p>
          <p class="card-note">
            The instructor should be prepared to prioritize core pieces—such as obstacles and
            one or two frameworks—if time runs short.

          <h3>Connection to other lessons</h3>
          <p>
            This lesson builds on ideas from Jason’s lesson on strategic learners, particularly
            the metacognitive skills required to set and pursue learning goals. The focus on
            cognitive development and thinking frameworks sets the stage for future lessons on
            active learning and other pedagogical strategies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Analysis of how well the lesson met its goals, and what should change next time,
            is provided in a separate teaching self-evaluation.
