<h1>What Are We Up Against?</h1><div class="card" id="study-summary"><h2>Study Spotlight: "They Don't Read Very Well" (Carlson et al., 2024)</h2>
  <p>Abstract: This paper analyzes the results from a think-aloud reading
study designed to test the reading comprehension skills of 85 English
majors from two regional Kansas universities. From January to April of
2015, subjects participated in a recorded, twenty-minute reading session
in which they were asked to read the first seven paragraphs of Charles
Dickens' Bleak House out loud to a facilitator and then translate each
sentence into plain English. Before subjects started the reading tests, they
were given access to online resources and dictionaries and advised that
they could also use their own cell phones as a resource. The facilitators
also assured the subjects that were free to go at their own pace and did
not have to finish reading all seven paragraphs by the end of the exam. As
part of the study, each subject filled out a survey collecting personal data
(class rank, G.P.A., etc.) and took a national literacy exam (the Degrees of
Reading Power Test 10A). After the 85 taped reading tests were completed,
the results were transcribed and coded.</p>
  <p>
<h2>Results:</h2> <p>58% (49/85) were classified as problematic: they grasped too little of the passage to read the novel unaided (though most believed they could); 38% (32/85) were competent: they caught more vocabulary and some figures of speech but only about half the literal prose; and 5% (4/85) were proficient: they tracked clauses closely and built accurate literal interpretations.</p>
 <h3> Example think-aloud from a competent reader:</h3>
<p> <b>Original Text</b> LONDON. Michaelmas Term lately over, and
the Lord Chancellor sitting in Lincoln’s Inn Hall. Implacable
November weather. As much mud in the streets, as if the waters
had but newly retired from the face of the earth, and it would
not be wonderful to meet a Megalosaurus, forty feet long or so,
waddling like an elephantine lizard up Holborn Hill. Smoke
lowering down . . . <br>
<b>Facilitator</b>: Before you go on, I’m going to ask you to kind of
explain.<br>
<b>Subject</b>: Oh, O.K. <br>
<b>Facilitator</b>: what you read so far, so. <br>
<b>Subject</b>: O.K. Two characters it’s pointed out this Michaelmas
and Lord Chancellor described as sitting in Lincoln’s Inn Hall. <br>
<b>Facilitator</b>: O.K. <br>
<b>Subject</b>: Um, talk about the November weather. Uh, mud in the
streets. And, uh, I do probably need to look up “Megalosaurus”—
“meet a Megalosaurus, forty feet long or so,” so it’s probably
some kind of an animal or something or another that it is talk-
ing about encountering in the streets. And “wandering like
an elephantine lizard up Holborn Hill.” So, yup, I think we’ve
encountered some kind of an animal these, these characters have,
have met in the street. yup, I think we’ve encountered some kind
of an animal these, these characters have, have met in the street</p>
<h3> Reading Proficiency vs. DRP Scores:</h3>
<p>
Linking the DRP to performance, everyone scoring under 79% on the DRP ended up problematic on Dickens; yet a majority (59%) of the problematic group had DRP scores above 90%, indicating that strong general reading scores didn't guarantee success with complex literary prose.

<ul>
<li><strong>Limited practice:</strong> Prior schooling often rewards memorization rather than reasoning.</li>
<li><strong>Limited time:</strong> Students optimize for efficiency unless thinking is explicitly valued.</li>
<li><strong>Limited patience:</strong> Open-ended tasks feel ambiguous and frustrating at first.</li>
<li><strong>Limited direction:</strong> Novices rarely see expert thinking modeled explicitly.</li>
<li><strong>Limited expectations:</strong> Many underestimate the relevance of deep thinking to careers.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Implication:</em> Build time, credit, and clarity for thinking itself—not just for coverage.</p>
