    <h2>The Passage</h2>
    <blockquote>
R. L. Moore was an important and influential faculty member at the University
of Texas from the 1920s to the 1970s. Possessed of a strong and single-minded
personality, he developed a special method of teaching that has been successfully
practiced and disseminated by his students and followers even to the present day.
The Moore method worked like this—and it was practiced in all his classes,
from the most elementary undergraduate to the most advanced graduate. Students
would show up on the first day, usually with no notion of what Moore was like
or what he expected. He would hand out a single mimeographed sheet with some
definitions and some axioms and some theorems stated on it. And he would say,
“Who would like to go to the board and prove the first theorem?” Of course Moore
was usually greeted by bewildered silence. Many of his students did not know the
meaning of the words “definition” and “axiom” and “theorem” and “proof,” nor
did they know the basic rules of logic. But Moore could take it. He sat and he
waited. Often the first hour would go by without a word spoken. And so would
the second. And many times the third as well. Eventually, some brave soul would
go to the blackboard and attempt a “proof” of Theorem 1. Moore would rip that
person apart. And that set the tone for the class.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
In each session of R. L. Moore’s class, some student would go to the board with
a proof he/she had concocted, and everyone else in the class—student and professor
alike—would examine it critically. There were no holds barred. Moore would not
assist the students in creating a proof, but he would respond to whatever they said.
The good thing about Moore’s classes is that his students came to possess the
mathematics. If you put it incorrectly on the blackboard, then you were subjected
to merciless criticism. If you got it right, then you received quiet but sincere
approbation.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
Moore did not allow his students to read books or papers (this included even
his graduate students!). Indeed Moore saw to it that the mathematics library got
no funds for new books! As legend had it, if he found a student of his in the library
he would throw that person (bodily) out the door. Students were to create the
mathematics themselves—from whole cloth. The class worked best if the students
began with approximately equal abilities. They were not allowed to read, and they
were not allowed to collaborate outside of class. Moore was merciless in weeding
out those students who did not cooperate or who did not fit in.
