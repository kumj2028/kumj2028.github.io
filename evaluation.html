        <p>
          The lesson centered on obstacles to higher-order thinking, frameworks for thinking, and
          strategies to improve thinking quality. I experimented with a <strong>random student
          picker</strong> right at the start, calling on Winn for the first question. Her visible
          discomfort and my own hesitation in responding showed me immediately how powerful and
          risky this tool could be. Simon, another classmate, stepped in to answer, and the lesson continued,
          but that moment framed much of my later reflection on participation and safety.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was my first time delivering a full lesson rather than a short presentation, and I
          was still tweaking the plan up to the last minute. In hindsight, I see both the value of
          careful lesson planning and the importance of leaving space for improvisation and student
          needs.

          I began my reflection with the numbers. The table below summarizes the mean, median,
          and variance for each item on the feedback form (scale 1-5):

              <td>1.78</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p style="margin-top:0.8rem;">
          The clearest message is that my <strong>subject-matter knowledge</strong> came across
          very strongly (mean ≈ 4.57, median = 5). At the same time, “Communicated Clearly” has
          the lowest mean (≈ 3.38) and also the smallest variance, which suggests that concerns
          about clarity are fairly consistent across students, not just outliers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other items, organization, participation, and increased understanding, cluster around
          a median of 4 but with relatively large variances, indicating that many students had
          positive experiences while a smaller group did not. This tells me that the structure of
          the lesson worked well for some, but not yet reliably for everyone.

        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Use of a website for the lesson:</strong> most students
            appreciated having the material on a website rather than traditional
            slides, and liked the structure it provided.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Community-built obstacle list:</strong> students valued
            collaboratively constructing a list of obstacles to higher-order
            thinking instead of being handed a pre-made list.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hearing thought processes, not just answers:</strong> some
            students enjoyed seeing peers explain how they arrived at answers,
            especially when the random selector called on them.

        <h3 style="margin-top:1rem;">What needs work</h3>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Website design and readability:</strong> there was often
            too much text on the screen at once and the font size was small,
            making it hard to follow.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Random student picker:</strong> some found it exciting and
            fair, while others felt it was stressful, forced, and occasionally
            unkind to unprepared students.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Communication style:</strong> multiple comments pointed to
            the need for a stronger voice, fewer filler words, and more
            deliberate movement and eye contact.

        <h3>Improving communication</h3>
        <p>
          To address the concerns about clarity and presence, I have begun
          attending a free online improvisational comedy course (<em>Radical
          Agreement</em>). Improv gives structured practice in speaking
          spontaneously, listening closely, and committing to what you say
          without hedging every sentence. I expect this to help with both my
          verbal clarity and my confidence in front of a class.
        </p>
        <p>
          For physical presence, I am experimenting with a remote control for navigating my teaching website. 
          If I can move through pages and sections by remote control, I can spend less time at the podium and
          more time moving around the room and making eye contact.
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:1rem;">Rethinking the random selector</h3>
        <p>
          I still believe there is value in tools that spread participation more
          evenly, but I need to use them more thoughtfully. Based on student
          suggestions, future modifications include:
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>
            Allowing a student to pass and then opening the question to the
            entire class.
          </li>
          <li>
            Selecting a small group of students and letting them choose which
            question they want to answer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Not permanently removing selected students from the pool, so no one
            can mentally “check out” after being called once.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top:1rem;">Designing the website for readability</h3>
        <p>
          I plan to restructure my teaching pages so that each screen contains
          less text, with larger fonts and more visual hierarchy. Since a
          website is more customizable than static slides, I can use collapsible
          sections, better spacing, and interactive elements rather than long
          paragraphs of text.

        <h3>Objective 1 - Obstacles to higher-order thinking (mostly successful)</h3>
        <p>
          Students were able to generate a rich list of obstacles and connect
          them to their own experiences. The open-ended comments suggest that
          they appreciated both the individual reflections and the class-wide
          synthesis.
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:1rem;">Objective 2 - Thinking frameworks (partially successful)</h3>
        <p>
          Asking students to identify and contrast different thinking frameworks
          had mixed results. Some liked having definitions to anchor the more
          open discussion, but many felt the activity lacked context—some found
          it too easy, others too hard. In hindsight, I focused so much on not
          simply “giving away” the answer that I did not set up the question
          properly.
        </p>
        <p>
          One suggestion I want to adopt is to frame these frameworks with
          <strong>stories and historical context</strong>. Rather than dropping
          labels out of nowhere, I can connect them to specific people,
          classroom situations, or historical shifts in educational thinking.
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:1rem;">Objective 3 - Strategies to improve thinking (largely unsuccessful)</h3>
        <p>
          I ran out of time before we could meaningfully tackle strategies for
          improving thinking quality. This was less about student engagement
          and more about my own <strong>time management</strong>: I spent too
          long on earlier segments and tried to cover too much in one lesson.
        </p>
        <p>
          Going forward, I intend to budget time more deliberately, identify
          which parts of a lesson are truly essential, and be willing to skip or
          shorten less critical elements to protect space for application and
          synthesis.

      <div class="card">
        <p>
          This was my first experience teaching a full lesson to a classroom of
          peers, and it was both frightening and energizing. I saw very clearly
          how my experiments could create stress as well as engagement, and how
          much I still have to learn about pacing, presence, and clarity. At the
          same time, I was struck by how supportive my classmates were, both in
          the moment and in their written feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          Writing this evaluation has convinced me even more that teaching is a
          craft I want to keep working on. I made mistakes, but they are
          mistakes I can learn from, and I am excited to try again with these
          lessons in mind.
