        <figcaption>Some of my fondest memories during my undergraduate years were from being on a game development team and making a game called <a href="https://gdiac.cis.cornell.edu/gallery/download.php%EF%B9%96name=reflexio.html">Reflexio</a>. Unfortunately, the game was written in an old game engine called XNA that is no longer supported, so the version shown on the page may not run on modern systems. However, one of my teammates, Amy Lanclos, has updated it to work with FNA at this github repository: <a href="https://github.com/ajl275/Reflexio" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Reflexio GitHub repository">https://github.com/ajl275/Reflexio</a>. If I have the time, I will try to make it playable on the web as well. Stay tuned.
